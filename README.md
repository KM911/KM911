## Greetings :wave: .  

This is KM911.  A student ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/from-Wuhan-green) who is currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree program is scheduled to graduate in 2025.

I am not smart :face_with_thermometer:  and have not been exposed to computers :computer: since I was young :baby_bottle: . To be honest , I am little envious :heart: of those who have a high level of coding skills :keyboard: . 

I told myself that no one is born with the ability to write code. Others' success comes from their daily hard work :facepunch: . So I hope I can also make up for my innate shortcomings through my own efforts. 

Hope everyone who works hard could have a good ending.

Looking for job relevant ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-cloud_native-blue)  .You could know more about me by my github repo.
